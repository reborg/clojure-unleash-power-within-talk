# We know the basics already

* It's a Lisp! It's functional!
* First class persistent data structures
* Great JVM interoperability
* Concurrent and generally fast
* REPL, macros and much moreâ€¦

# Reflecting on 11 years of Clojure

* Innovation, impact, expressiveness...
* What was Clojure able to achieve?
* When it wasn't, why not?
* The list is long (and subjective)

# A word about the examples/demo

* I'm mainly searching for the principles
* Code shown could be about initial sketches
* For any serious development go to latest!
* **Hang tight!** We are going to cover a lot.
